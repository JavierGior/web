AMRITA BHOOMI;LA VIA CAMPESINA SOUTH ASIA;India;Amrita Bhoomi (meaning Eternal Earth) is a Centre for Sustainable Development and School of Agroecology founded by the Indian peasant movement KRRS in Karnataka in South India. It consists of several components that reflect our commitment to a more prosperous, equitable and ecological future. These components revolve around the training and promotion of agroecology and natural agriculture, renewable energy, green building, and economic diversification based on small cottage industries, as well as education, combating child labor, inequality and discrimination, and the creation of cooperatives and direct links between producers and consumers. All of these components are oriented towards greater self-reliance and capacity for collective action of the peasant communities. Local communities want to be provided with educational tools through this project so they can rebuild their independence and dignity. Amrita Bhoomi works towards the eradication of poverty through the collective construction of ecological and equitable local economies that protect them from the ravages of the global market. The project is a response to the disastrous crisis facing the rural economy in India, reflected in the rising tide of suicides among rural families drowning in debt (according to the latest government data, more than 200,000 peasants committed suicide between 1993 and 2013 because of their indebtedness, and that figure reflects only officially documented cases and does not include suicide attempts), and mass migration to urban slums in cities. In this context, Amrita Bhoomi contributes to the reconstruction of food sovereignty and agricultural and livestock biodiversity, sustainable self-management of natural resources, universal access to education and to strengthen local economies that allow the permanence of farmer communities in their territory and give them a positive outlook for the future. The residential Training Center on Life Cycles and the School of Agroecology have already been built, including the housing for the staff working permanently in the center, and a Livestock Bank. After a first experiment on a small plot, this year, agroecological farming will be implemented through a Model Farm on 20 hectares. For the next few years, the equipping of the Seed Bank, the Reserve of Medicinal Plants, more housing for staff working permanently in the center, and a nursery (for the staff and children of those receiving training), Center for Economic Diversification, and an alternative school called Green School are planned. The Center aims to operate at full capacity and become economically self-sufficient. The Center is an essential part of the long-term strategy of the movement of farmers in the state of Karnataka and its youth wing the Green Brigade. The patronage of the Amrita Bhoomi Foundation includes representatives of other movements Indian farmers who are enacting a close monitoring of the project in order to replicate it in other regions. Beyond India, various organizations of La Via Campesina (in which KRRS played and continues to play a central role) continue the project with great interest, because they want to carry out projects with similar approaches in their countries. Amrita Bhoomi is the seat of the first School of Agroecology of La Via Campesina in South Asia.;https://amritabhoomi.org/;;11,9136358;77,0777397

'CENTRE INTERNATIONAL DE FORMATION À L''AGROÉCOLOGIE PAYSANNE DE NYÉLÉNI';COORDINATION NATIONALE DES ORGANISATIONS PAYSANNES (CNOP);Bamako, Malí;'Mali''s Coordination Nationale des Organisations Paysannes (CNOP) established the International Center for Training in Peasant Agroecology – Nyéléni at the time of the International Forum for Food Sovereignty in 2007. Since then, it has become the hub of peasant agroecology training across the country, thanks largely to CNOP facilitators working together with local promoters in 20 different rural Malian communities. Combining political and technical training with literacy reinforcement programs, the Centre's aim is to empower rural communities to defend, demand, and develop food sovereignty through peasant agroecology. Training the trainers, Nyéléni currently offers the following modules to CNOP and allied peasant agroecology promoters: (1) the pillars of peasant agroecology, (2) native seed selection, saving and exchange, (3) animal husbandry and vaccination, (4) agrosilvopastoral systems, (5) small-scale fish ponds, (6) water harvesting and management, (7) strengthening of soil organic matter, and (8) the transformation of harvested crops such as rice, maize, and millets. All of these are developed in a decentralized way, adapted to local social and ecological conditions, with promoters encouraged to engage in community-based experimentation and dialogue based on a consensus with elected officials (maire), community leaders (chefs de village), heads of households (chefs de famille), and training participants (apprenants). After each training, promoters are asked to report back on the challenges faced and needs identified by each community involved.';http://www.cnop-mali.org/;;12.6465431;-8.0031435

LA DURETTE - GRAB;EUROPEAN COORDINATION OF LA VIA CAMPESINA (ECVC);France;The durette farm is a unique initiative in France. It is a 5ha pilot farm in garden agroforestry, located in a peri-urban area (Avignon). It is a real-size research mechanism “system”, in which farmers perform their economic activity. The research led by GRAD and its partners (INRA, Agriculture Chamber…) focuses on the assessment of agronomic, ecological, economical performances of a diversified system, based on biodiversity (domestic/not cultivated) to ensure a strong resilience and phasing out of the use of inputs. The multiannual assessment of such alternative system should allow to show the sustainability of an agroforesty farm in diversified gardening. The Durette farm is now part of a farm network assessed in 2015 and 2016: the SMART project. It serves as an exhibition and training center on issues linked to agroecology.;http://www.grab.fr/;;43.1757608;2.9944903

The goal of the encampment was to bring people together to work and learn with one another and study agroecology as a tool of struggle within the current political context. The methodology of the encampment consisted of farm work in the mornings, followed by facilitated discussions on topics including the agrarian history of Puerto Rico, agroecology as a tool for social struggle and gender dynamics within social movements. The facilitated discussions were followed by more informal conversations around a campfire, during which the participants further discussed ideas generated throughout the day. Tasks such as cooking and cleaning were shared among teams of participants during the encampment, and one team also assumed the task of note-taking during discussions. Towards the end of the process, they synthesized the ideas generated into a draft declaration that was then edited and approved by the encampment’s participants.;https://viacampesina.org/en/agroecology-in-puerto-rico/#;;18,1370616;-66,3273971
